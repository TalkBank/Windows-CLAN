VOCD:

Little to say at this time. VOCD is a program for the assessment
of lexical diversity in speakers utterances.

VOCD depends on the following files:

args.h
dcompute.h
filter.h
speaker.h
tokens.h
vocdefs.h

main.c
args.c
dcompute.c
filter.c
speaker.c
tokens.c

Developed by Gerard McKee at the University of Reading,
under an ESRC funded research project led by
Brian Richards and David Malvern (Faculty of Education Studies).

Installation:

Unix installation is simple, assuming you are using gnu:
Run 'make vocd' in the vocd directory
The output, 'vocd', is compiled to the vocd directory.

Problems:

Should in the first instance be directed to Brian Richards at
b.j.richards@reading.ac.uk.
